# WeatherReportWP
A small weather application that shows how to create API queries using axios with getem, thanks to which we do not have to compile anything on json, and we already have all the information in res.data ..., using the .then method (coming from the Featch API) . This code shows: how to select query components, how to find these elements in the shared API, how to retrieve them or possibly modify them from an array to an object and create references to its components, among others, using the Object.assign ({}, ... res) construct .data.weather); using the API from the address: https://openweathermap.org/.
